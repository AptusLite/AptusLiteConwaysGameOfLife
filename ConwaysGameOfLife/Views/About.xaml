                Is an implementation by AptusLite, of the famous cellular automaton 'Conway's Game of Life',
                devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway 
                <LineBreak/>
                (26 December 1937 – 11 April 2020).

                <LineBreak/>
                The rules are as follows:
                <LineBreak/>
                    - Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
                <LineBreak/>
                    - Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
                <LineBreak/>
                    - All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
