AptusLite - Conway's Game of Life Implementation

Is an implementation by AptusLite, of the famous cellular automaton 'Conway's Game of Life',
devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway (26 December 1937 â€“ 11 April 2020).

The rules are as follows:
	- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
	- Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
	- All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
